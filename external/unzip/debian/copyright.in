This is the Debian prepackaged version of "unzip", Info-Zip's fast,
portable, zipfile decompression utility.

This package is currently maintained by Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>
and built from sources obtained from:

ftp://ftp.info-zip.org/pub/infozip/src/unzip60.tgz

The changes were fairly minimal, and consisted solely of adding
various debian/* files to the distribution, plus several miscellaneous
fixes as reflected in the Debian changelog.
